# icp_token_wallet
 this program is a Rust implementation of an Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) token wallet. The wallet uses the dfinity_sdk crate to interact with the Internet Computer, and the hex crate to handle hexadecimal encoding and decoding. The serde crate is used for serialization and deserialization of data.
