# icp_token_wallet
 this program is a Rust implementation of an Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) token wallet. The wallet uses the dfinity_sdk crate to interact with the Internet Computer, and the hex crate to handle hexadecimal encoding and decoding. The serde crate is used for serialization and deserialization of data.


# Overview
This project provides a basic implementation of a token wallet for the ICP blockchain, utilizing the dfinity-sdk crate as a dependency. The wallet allows users to manage their token balances and perform transactions on the ICP network.


# Features
Token balance management
Transaction processing (send and receive tokens)
Support for the ICP blockchain



# Prerequisites 
Rust installed on your system
dfinity-sdk crate installed as a dependency
